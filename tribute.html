            Jean-Baptiste Joseph Fourier (/ˈfʊrieɪ, -iər/;[1] French: [fuʁje]; 21 March 1768 – 16 May 1830) was a French
            mathematician and physicist born in Auxerre and best known for initiating the investigation of Fourier
            series, which eventually developed into Fourier analysis and harmonic analysis, and their applications to
            problems of heat transfer and vibrations. The Fourier transform and Fourier's law of conduction are also
            named in his honour. Fourier is also generally credited with the discovery of the greenhouse effect.

            In 1822, Fourier published "The Analytical Theory of Heat," which made important contributions to
            mathematics and physics. He claimed that any function of a variable can be expanded in a series of sines,
            which laid the foundation for the Fourier transform. He also introduced the concept of dimensional
            homogeneity in equations and proposed his partial differential equation for conductive diffusion of heat,
            which is now a fundamental concept in mathematical physics.

            In 1830, his diminished health began to take its toll:

            Fourier had already experienced, in Egypt and Grenoble, some attacks of aneurysm of the heart. At Paris, it
            was impossible to be mistaken with respect to the primary cause of the frequent suffocations which he
            experienced. A fall, however, which he sustained on the 4th of May 1830, while descending a flight of
            stairs, aggravated the malady to an extent beyond what could have been ever feared.

            Shortly after this event, he died in his bed on 16 May 1830.

            Fourier was buried in the Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris, a tomb decorated with an Egyptian motif to
            reflect his position as secretary of the Cairo Institute, and his collation of Description de l'Égypte. His
            name is one of the 72 names inscribed on the Eiffel Tower.

            A bronze statue was erected in Auxerre in 1849, but it was melted down for armaments during World War II.
            Joseph Fourier University in Grenoble is named after him.
